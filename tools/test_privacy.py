"""Refuse to let identifying information reach a public repository.

    python tools/test_privacy.py

This repository is public. One tracked file carried the author's Windows
account name inside a hardcoded absolute path, and it went out in a commit
and sat in the tree of sixteen more before anyone thought to look. Thinking
to look is not a mechanism. This is the mechanism.

NOTHING PERSONAL IS WRITTEN IN THIS FILE, and that is a requirement rather
than a nicety: a checker that blocklists a name would publish that name to
every reader of the repository it is meant to protect. So every rule is
either DERIVED at runtime or an ALLOWLIST of shapes known to be safe.

  * The account name comes from `Path.home().name` on the machine running
    the check. It is never stored.
  * Commit identities are checked against a PATTERN -- GitHub's
    `<id>+<user>@users.noreply.github.com` privacy form, or an explicit
    noreply -- rather than against a list of forbidden addresses.
  * Home-directory paths are matched by shape: `C:/Users/<anything>/`,
    `/home/<anything>/`, `/Users/<anything>/`.

THE IDENTITY CHECK ONLY LOOKS AT THIS FORK'S OWN COMMITS. The history
inherited from upstream carries the upstream author's own address in their
own public repository; that is their identity, correctly attributed, and
rewriting it would put someone else's name on work under a different one.
The fork point is found from the upstream remote, and if that remote is
missing the check says so instead of quietly widening or narrowing.

Content in a tracked file can simply be edited. An identity already in
COMMIT HISTORY needs a history rewrite and a force-push, and once anyone
has cloned or forked the repository it cannot be recalled at all -- which
is why this runs before a commit rather than after a push.

# Two of the checks ask about THIS MACHINE, and a hosted CI runner is not it.

# answers they can give are wrong. A runner's home account is a service
# account, so searching tracked files for its name finds the word "runner"

# is generic the check reports "ok" while never having looked for a person's

# HISTORY. Everything above asks about the working tree, and that is the
# question that was already being answered correctly while nine blobs sat in
# this repository's history for sixty-seven commits. `git grep` reports the
# TREE; a push sends the OBJECTS. They are not the same question, and the
# narrow one is the one that feels like an answer.
#
# Cost is why this can be a check rather than an audit: one batched
# `git cat-file` streams every object in about a tenth of a second, where a
# process per object took most of a minute. A check too slow to run every
# time becomes an opt-in check, which is a check that does not run.
#
# NOTHING IS FED TO cat-file ON STDIN. Writing a list of object ids in while
# reading bodies out deadlocks the moment the output pipe fills, which it
# does within the first megabyte -- the first version of this hung for ten
# minutes. `--batch-all-objects` needs no stdin at all, and the paths come
# from a separate, cheap `rev-list` that produces text and nothing else.
